# Umbrel App

As a regular user you must use the official integrated application through [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel). This way you could switch between mainnet and testnet network.

If you really want to tinker with this app, read [this](https://github.com/ln-markets/umbrel/tree/master/dev/README.md) to know how to setup your env properly.
